## Description

This API is a small example of how a social network backend would look like, it allows you to create new `users` which can add eachother as friends, you can create posts called `thoughts` which your friends can react to, and you can delete/update your thoughts and your user information as well. This API uses all CRUD operations alongside the mongoose ORM to execute all the features mentioned above. This project helped me get confortable with mongoose, a NoSQL ORM, it pushed me to reasearch many methods and operators that are avaliable in the ORM, and to learn about how they can be used and the benefits of using mongoose. This project also helped me realize that mongoose might be one of my favourite ORM's so far!

## Installation

This project does require some packages to be installed, as well as node.js to install them. If you dont have node.js installed you can do so by going to (Nodejs.org)[https://nodejs.org/en/]. Once that is done and you wish to install the required packages you can do so by opening the terminal and running the command `npm i` which will install all the dependencies found in the package.json. Once that is completed the server can be started using the command `node index.js`

## Usage

This project showcases the benefits of using mongoose when creating the backend of a social network aplication, this project can be used as a cheat sheet for whoever is trying to build a social network as this API can definetly be further developed to create a fully operational social network similar to Twitter.
